		description:
			"This project was developed during the CPEN 291 course. It consists of an autonomous system to allow or deny access into establishment based on COVID-19 vaccination status, self-assessment, and temperature, including an admin portal to visualize data and notify clients in case of exposure to the virus. I was responsible to lead the team and plan the project architecture: technologies used, integration between components, and user flow. In addition to this, I created APIs to connect views with the Arduino components via Node.js and Johnny-Five platform, developed front-end views in React, and the mass emails system via SendGrid mail.",

			"Hireflow is an internal tool developed by my sub-team at UBC Launch Pad design team. Its objective is to make the process of recruitment faster and centralized. Instead of having the data spread in multiple excels, forms, and emailing tools that require manual processing, our app allows to manage all the data and the whole application process in a single dashboard. My role in the teams was as Front-End developer creating views and React components",

			"This is another project for our CPEN 291 course. During this project we created a dancing robot with sensors, server motors, display, Led and a 3D-printed body. The robot brain was an Itsy Bitsy M4 Express programmed with Circuit Python. The decision for the Batman theme was a weight distribution solution, but it added a nice aesthetics to the final design.
